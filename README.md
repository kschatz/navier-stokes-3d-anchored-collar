## Abstract

We prove global regularity and uniqueness for Leray Hopf suitable solutions of the three dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations.

The key new input is a local scale invariant anchored collar mechanism on thin spherical annuli:
(i) a two sided Dirichlet to Neumann law for the elliptic resolvent with cap Neumann data obtained via a one sided Carleman Rellich inequality and a Dirichlet to Neumann Slepian spectral split; and
(ii) an anchored flux absorption inequality for admissible test fields built from the same resolvent.

Both estimates hold with geometry only constants independent of scale. Together with a two sided Littlewood Paley alignment and the time integrated collar capture AC2 TI these inputs convert the local energy inequality into a uniform scale invariant dissipation bound on Whitney collars.

From there we obtain a fixed ratio contraction for the Caffarelli Kohn Nirenberg functional, a reverse Holder estimate in time for the dissipation, a Gehring upgrade for the velocity gradient, and the classical epsilon regularity conclusion.

A Vitali covering propagates smoothness to every finite time slab yielding global smoothness on three dimensional Euclidean space for all positive times and uniqueness in the Leray Hopf class.
